Lorem Ipsum... just kidding. My name is Marcus Plienegger and I'm a software developer based in Toronto, Canada. In addition to frontend development, I'm also proficient in backend technologies written
mostly in Javascript. The scope of these are often referred to as _Fullstack development_, which also suits me well.  

These days I'm mostly interested in React and other frontend libraries and frameworks. Aside from writing software I'm also an avid reader of books, consumer of coffee ‚òï, and my latest hobby: [Longboarding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNETYg7b4Pw)üèÑ
