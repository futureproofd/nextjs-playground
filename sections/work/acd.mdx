My primary focus was refactoring an internal legacy software base, originally written in VBScript, to a C# backend Web Application. Many iterations and proposals led to the continual evolution of the software 
including, but not limited to a **React** implementation. Here are somesome of the highlights and features I worked on:  

#### Frontend to Backend ####  

- Migrated entire legacy VBScript code-base to a C# Web Application
  - ASP.NET Framework running a Javascript frontend (primarily [Dojo Toolkit](https://dojotoolkit.org/))
  - Backend implementation required writing all new C# [DLL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic-link_library) libraries for business logic
- Migrated user forms to use React for Lead processing (a process to convert potential Leads into Contacts)
  - Redux state management, including Thunk middleware for API calls via [SData](https://sage.github.io/SData-2.0/)
  - Local state management via React Class-based components

#### Databases ####  

- Created Relational Database Stored Procedures, Functions, and Views via [T-SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transact-SQL)
  - Mainly used for retriving custom views on the frontend
    - Using an ORM Layer via [NHibernate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NHibernate)
  - Also used for gathering complex analytics data for targeting opportunities
