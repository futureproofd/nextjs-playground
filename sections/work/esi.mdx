My primary efforts have been in building a B2B [Web Plaform](https://www.exchangesolutions.com/es_loyalty/), written entirely in Typescript & React on the frontend. 
The application leverages an AWS architecture, primarily communicating via Lambda API endpoints (Also written in Typescript) and managing state via a Redux implementation. 
Some additional highlights include:

- Writing reusable components and libraries (Functional Components / Custom Hooks)
- Pre-processed CSS via scss extension
- Writing clean, concise, and well-tested code ([react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) / Jest)
  - Striving towards full code-coverage through unit/integration testing
- Integrating and writing for a serverless architecture, via AWS infrastructure
  - Including, but not limited to: Lambda, DynamoDB, Cognito, Amplify
