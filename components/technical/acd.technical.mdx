  #### Frontend ####

I wrote an [article](https://medium.com/@marcusp/extending-modules-with-dojo-toolkit-139b666e18a3) about extending Dojo Toolkit UI components. I originally wrote it to cement my knowledge at the time. 
That, and the implementation of the framework I was working with was complex and undocumented. I wanted to make sure I got it down in writing for myself and for others to reference.
  
Essentially what it's comprised of is a frontend placeholder for the Widget:

  ```HTML

    <div id="placeHolderControl" runat="server" />

  ```

Hooking into .Net lifecycle methods (_i.e. Page_Load()_) to call UI components via AMD.  
The AMD loader is providing our dependencies asynchronously for the subsequent function declaration.

  ```JS

    // Use AMD module.
    require(["lib/AmdModule"], amdModule => {
        amdModule.doSomething();
      });
    };

  ```

The full implementation looks as follows; We invoke startup() to initialize our UI Widget on our placeholder control:

```C#

  protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e){
    var script = new StringBuilder();
    // AMD Module dependencies.
    script.AppendLine("@ require(['lib/AmdModule'], (AmdModule) => {")
    
    string baseScript = string.Format("window.setTimeout(() => {"+
      "const module = new AmdModule({placeHolder: {0}}); "+
      "module.startup();"+
      "}, 1);",
      placeHolderControl.CliendID
    )
  }

  ```

  Defining a custom UI Widget to invoke (as shown above) via extending the Dojo toolkit is an exercise in itself; 
  Using AMD's _define_ method and providing a dependency array of base widgit(s) is the standard way for creating a new control. 
  What we're essentially doing is extending base objects via prototypal inheritance. The article explains this in detal.  

  This is by no means ideal, but sometimes we're stuck using the tools provided. 
  It's worth noting that we've come a long way in writing Javascript modules yet it's always sobering to look back on earlier implementations.  

  #### React implementation ####

  The backend data is retrieved via [SData Javascript library](https://github.com/Sage/SDataJavaScriptClientLib) to an NHibernate ORM layer that exposes the SQL Database.
  Writing functional components on the frontend using the native fetch API is a preferable strategy to the above implementation.
